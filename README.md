### Fashion MNIST
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.You can read more about this at [Kaggle]


### Tech

Fashion MNIST Classification uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [numpy] - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* [pytorch] - An open source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment
* [matplotlib] - Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms
* [torchvision] - The torchvision package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision
* [python] - Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language
